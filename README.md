🧱 Simple Java Blockchain
A basic implementation of a blockchain written in Java. This project demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain such as blocks, hashes, proof-of-work (mining), and chain validation.

📁 Project Structure

📦 SimpleBlockchain
├── Main.java           // Entry point for the program
├── Block.java          // Defines the Block class
├── Fingerprint.java    // SHA-256 hash function utility

🚀 Features
1)SHA-256 hashing
2)Proof-of-work mining with difficulty level
3)Blockchain integrity validation
4)JSON output using Gson
5)Block creation with timestamp and data

🛠️ Requirements
Java 8 or higher
Gson Library (from Google)
